# bookmarker

Bookmarking, clippings, annotation, archiving and research app

The primary usecase we wish to solve is a better bookmarking service.
It should provide full-text search on all bookmarked pages as well
as web archives for them so that one can see a webpage even if it goes down.

Instead of folders as many bookmarking servieces use to organize the bookmarks
I'd like to use tags.
